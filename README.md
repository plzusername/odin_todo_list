## Introduction

Hello and welcome, to the most overengineered implementation of a todoApp you might ever see! For this one, I decided to go all in with features, although I consider the result a bit overkill, this was a great learning experience, and I truly thank [The odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for allowing me the opportunity the build this one of a kind todoApp!

## Learning outcomes

The main topics I practiced in this project include the following:

- npm
- code seperation
    - ES6 modules
    - Nested folders
- SOLID desiegn principles
- LocalStorage
- JSON functions
- SVG importing


## deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plzusername/odin_todo_list.git

cd odin_todo_list
```
